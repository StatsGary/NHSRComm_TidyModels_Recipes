# TidyModels and Recipes in R

This webinar was designed for the NHS-R Community to look at the new TidyModels developments, and to build on the previous webinar where I discussed the use of Machine Learning in Caret. This seems like the next natural progression for this type of work. 

## The TidyModels Framework

The session will align with the TidyModels framework:

## The session 

The session will look at:
<ol>
  <li>Building a regression and classification model</li>
  <li>Working with the Recipes package to preprocess your data ready for a predictive model</li>
  <li>Approaches to data splitting and cross validation with rsample</li>
  <li>Building a baseline model with Parsnip</li>
  <li>Improving this with hyperparameter tuning</li>
  <li>Evaluating your model with Yardstick</li>
</ol>

## Caret modelling
To look at a previous session I did around Advanced Modelling using Caret, either navigate to: [Advanced Modelling with CARET](https://nhsrcommunity.com/learn-r/workshops/advanced-modelling-supervised-ml/) or: [Advanced Modelling with CARET](https://hutsons-hacks.info/advanced-modelling-in-r-with-caret-a-focus-on-supervised-machine-learning).
